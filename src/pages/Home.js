    <h3>HI 👋🏽</h3>
    <h4>I'm Marialaina</h4>
    <p> I’m a software engineer with a passion for building and creating new things, with a strong inquisition about the way things work.  Took an interest in building  websites using Ruby On Rails;  by building websites,  I found a passion in writing code. I started off constructing buildings, and took a lot of pride in helping build something for people. Now that I have the opportunity, I’ve been exercising my love for creating new projects through software development.</p>
